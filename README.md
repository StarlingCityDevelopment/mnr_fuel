## Monarch Fuel
Script born from the fusion of the feature-rich script [cdn-fuel](https://github.com/CodineDev/cdn-fuel) plus some parts of the highly optimized [ox_fuel](https://github.com/overextended/ox_fuel), the goal of this script is to give the community a script that is neither a mess of poorly organized lines nor a script too essential and lacking in functions

## Credits
- CodineDev for original script (cdn-fuel)
- overextended Team (the old one that leaved) for fuel method with statebags (ox_fuel)
- jgscripts for informations about ev found on a cfx post
